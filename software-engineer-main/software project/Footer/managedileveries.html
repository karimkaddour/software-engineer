<h1>FAQ - Manage Deliveries</h1>

<h2>1. How can I track my delivery?</h2>
<p>To track your delivery, you can use the tracking number provided in your order confirmation email. Simply enter the tracking number on our website's tracking page to get real-time updates on the status of your delivery.</p>

<h2>2. Can I change the delivery address after placing my order?</h2>
<p>In most cases, you can update the delivery address for your order before it's shipped. Contact our customer support team as soon as possible with your order details and the new delivery address, and we'll do our best to accommodate your request.</p>

<h2>3. What should I do if my delivery is delayed?</h2>
<p>If your delivery is delayed beyond the estimated delivery date, please contact our customer support team for assistance. We'll investigate the issue and provide updates on the status of your delivery as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>4. Can I schedule a specific delivery time?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee specific delivery times for standard shipments. However, you may have the option to choose expedited shipping for faster delivery or contact the carrier directly to request a specific delivery time for an additional fee.</p>

<h2>5. What happens if I'm not home to receive my delivery?</h2>
<p>If you're not home to receive your delivery, the carrier may leave a delivery notice with instructions for rescheduling delivery or picking up your package from a local distribution center. Alternatively, you can authorize someone else to receive the delivery on your behalf.</p>

<h2>6. How do I return or exchange an item?</h2>
<p>If you need to return or exchange an item, please follow the instructions provided in our return policy. Typically, you'll need to initiate a return request through your account on our website and follow the steps to print a return label and ship the item back to us.</p>

<h2>7. How do I contact customer support for delivery-related issues?</h2>
<p>If you have any delivery-related issues or questions, you can contact our customer support team by email, phone, or live chat. Visit the "Contact Us" page on our website for more information.</p>
